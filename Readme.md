# G.O.A.P. Warrior (WIP)
G.O.A.P. Warrior is a delightfully overengineered approach to tackling [WarriorJS](https://github.com/olistic/warriorjs) that attempts to control the warrior using [Goal Oriented Action Planning](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/gdc2006_orkin_jeff_fear.pdf).

This is a work in progress. So far, the warrior has reached level 9. Because I'm adding to and modifying the warriors actions, goals and senses as needed while climbing the tower, it might not be possible to run this script successfully from level 1 in it's current state without selectively disabling or modifying some actions.

## Note on debugging
`debug.html` and `debug.js` form a simple imitation of WarriorJS that I use for debugging the action planner using the browser's debugger. This imitation is only ever as accurate as I need it to be for debugging a certain aspect of the script.
